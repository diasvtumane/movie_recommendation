Why Do I need it?
I created it because my girlfriend and I always run out of movie ideas. 

The project uses cosine similarity and CountVectorizer from the SkLearn library.
It is not really complicated, and I would even say it is a beginner-level AI project so you should be able use it on your own without any specific instructions.
I have almost left comments everywhere if you have a hard time understanding my code

You can use this project to make your bot or just enhance mine. I might enhance it later.
